##EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project has been implemented using Spring Boot, ReactJs and PostgreSQL.

It is a system that can be used to monitor events such as cinema, theater, conference and meeting. It can be used by internal and external users. 

A new event can be added, quota can be updated, event information can be updated and deleted in the admin panel. 

An event can be consulted, event information can be viewed, and the event location can be viewed on the map in the external user panel. If a user applies for the event, event information and a QRCode for login are sent to their e-mail address.
